## 1. Project Background
The USF Handshake Data Analysis and Tableau Visualization project aims to provide insights into the post-COVID-19 Data Science job market across the U.S. by narrowing down areas with the highest recruitment activity. This project serves as a valuable resource for students, job seekers, and educational institutions, helping them identify regions actively hiring for Data Science roles in the evolving job market.
## 2. Executive Summary
This project analyzes the current landscape of Data Science job opportunities in the U.S. using data sourced from the Handshake platform, with a specific focus on identifying states with the **highest job openings, work authorization requirements, company sizes, and industries with the highest salaries**. The insights gained from this project are designed to assist students in strategically targeting regions with the most active Data Science recruitment efforts and understanding the factors influencing employment in this field.
<br/>The dashboard presents a visualization of job openings across the U.S., segmented by **states, work authorization requirements, company sizes, and salary trends across industries. Based on these findings, the project has successfully secured interviews for five students in Data Science roles, demonstrating the efficacy of data-driven career strategies.

## 3. In-sight Deep Dive
### a. Geography Distribution of the Job:
- **Florida, California, Texas**, and **Georgia** show the highest job openings, with **New York, Illinois**, and **Pennsylvania** as secondary options.
### b. Work Authorization
- Around **45%** of jobs require U.S. work authorization, but a significant portion accepts OPT/CPT or sponsors visas, offering opportunities for international students.
### c. Company size
-  Small to mid-sized firms (100-250, 250-1,000 employees) and large enterprises (25,000+ employees) actively hire Data Science professionals.
### d. Industries with Highest Salaries
- **Staffing & Recruiting** offers the highest salary at **$58,824**, followed by **Medical Devices** at **$53,195**, with other sectors offering competitive pay around **$47,000**.
### e. Proposed Actions for the Department
- Target internships/applications in **FL, CA, TX, GA**; assist international students with visa-sponsoring companies; build industry connections with high-paying sectors to increase student placements.
## 4. Assumption and Prediction
### a. Assumption
- States like FL, CA, TX, and GA will continue to see strong growth in Data Science job demand post-COVID-19.
- Companies open to sponsoring work visas will remain vital for international students in the Data Science field.
- High-paying industries such as Staffing & Recruiting, Medical Devices, and Consulting will maintain their demand for Data Science professionals.
- Small/mid-sized companies and large enterprises will continue dominating Data Science hiring.
### b. Prediction
- **Increased Hiring in Tech Hubs**: Data Science job postings will rise in tech-friendly states like Texas and Florida as they attract more businesses.
- **Growth of International Opportunities:** More U.S. companies will open up OPT/CPT and visa-sponsoring roles for international students.
- **Rising Salaries in Data Science**: Demand for skilled professionals will push salaries higher, particularly in Medical Devices and Consulting.
- **Shift Towards Hybrid/Remote Roles**: Remote and hybrid work will increase Data Science job postings in non-traditional tech regions.
